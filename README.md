MedicoCare Hospital is a modern, responsive hospital website created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is designed to showcase a hospitalâ€™s services, display doctors' profiles, and provide users with an intuitive interface to learn about the medical facilities available. The site emphasizes clean UI, responsive design for all screen sizes, and interactive service details toggled using JavaScript.

This project simulates a real-world hospital landing page and can be expanded to include backend integration for appointment bookings, contact forms, login systems, and patient management. All features are implemented using only frontend technologies, making it a great practice project for beginners and intermediate developers.
